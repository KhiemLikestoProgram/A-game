# Impromptu
It's just a normal console app (with search and many other features that I developed only in Python. I'll learn others next month.
## What is this
- I think this is like cmd but not as good as it. (I think, not you or others)
##
## Why do I stuck here?
- What? I thought this was private...
OK then, you can watch
##
## Hmmm... Why does the file's name is "impromptu.exe"?
- It's because I don't have plan (you think it's a bad respond? but I'm a pre-teen!!!)
